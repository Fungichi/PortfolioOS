## Why i made this project (with lovable):

I never really felt the desire to make my own portfolio website because i did not know how i wanted it to look like, and i never really used github (up untill now 2025).

Furthermore I still do not have enough projects that I am actually proud of. So I thought: "Whats the point of making a portfolio website where there is absolutely nothing to put on the website".

But then i came across this website: [https://retrospect.hackclub.com/](https://retrospect.hackclub.com/ "https://retrospect.hackclub.com/") from nora.

Then I figured this was something I wanted to make.

But because I am a developer with almost no frontend experience I decided to give lovable a try.

And i love it because i just gave it a few prompts and now i am editing the contents manually so that i can fully tailor it to me.
